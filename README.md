# GettingDataAssignment
This R script was made as part of a Coursera course assignment. It takes the input from this zip file, https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip, and creates a tidy data set with a subset of the data in the data frame "tidy".

To run it:

1. Place the script in your working directory.
2. Extract the zip file with the source data to the same directory.
3. Source the R script
